                                                              Crusader-Kings-2
Crusader Kings II
	  The book tells us reinforcing loops and balancing loops in a complex system create a metastable systemic behavior. In the Crusader Kings 
  II we can see that every decision the player make as a part and every property you have in this game as a part, in this game we have act 
  like a king and conquer the world, each move we made will impact the entire game, the detail of the game such as the ability of your 
  general or your wife is important, this is the part of the game and it creates a larger whole with a loops, the loops are every turn you
  take, the upper right corner have a slower and faster button,  when you push that button basically you end the turn, every decision you 
  made will show the result like make money from worker or pay money to them and the diplomacy. When Crusader Kings II is being played, 
  and the parts are moving around in their loops, a larger whole emerges. This larger whole can be described as each property you have when
  you end of a turn, the wealth, prestige, piety, score. The goal is the make this property you have as many as possible, you have to win 
  with the condition that you have a lot of this because you need wealth or prestige to declare a war and let other country to help you.
 
 The emergent effect is overall metastability, metastability create a set of organized behaviors but it can’t found in any individua parts
  , we need to see it as a whole not individually, like the army we have, we can’t just see only a single solider, an army contain a general
  and different kind of property and there are many armies in a country, they need to move to one place and combine in order to fight 
  another country, this game is basic on a real history event and real character from Middle Ages, when you start the game it will provide 
  you a script about the king you choose and the goal, when you choose to form alliance with others, you need to have enough prestige to 
  form an alliance with other country, same as to plot to kill, you can assassinate someone if they want to take over the country, you can
  ask other people to join you, you can send a gift to other if they won’t join. This is not a part or a loop, but emerges from the movement
  of parts in loops, the emergent things keep the game metastable, when you choose you character you can choose the characteristic they have
  , but it will cost, for example if you choose the ability smart you will start like around 50 years old, but it doesn’t matter, although 
  you will died fast but you can still play the game if you have any child left, if you lose in battle it doesn’t matter either, you can 
  also play the game if you have any child left.
